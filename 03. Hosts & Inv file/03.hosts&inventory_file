Hosts file defines hosts and group of hosts with their corresponding private/public ip address 
can be used in Playbook(tasks) and in Ad-hoc commands.

We can add individual ip or group of ip under single "GROUP NAME"

--------------------------------
RULES FOR ADDING HOSTS
------------------
[group_name] -->inside [] only we need to add group_name
<ip> 
or
<name_of_individual_host> ansible_ssh_host=<host_ip> 

Can add the group under another group as children also
[Common:childern] 
group_name1
group_name2

-----------------------------------------------------------
Default Hosts location in ansible:
-----------------------------------------------
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
#press i (insert mode), add host details
[group_name] -->inside [] only we need to add group_name
<ip> 
or
<name_of_individual_host> ansible_ssh_host=<host_ip> 
#press esc button and :wq or :x (save and quit)

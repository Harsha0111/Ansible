# Ansible offers a set of variables that deserve their own special mention â€“ magic variables. 
# These are variables that are always set when a playbook is run without them having to be explicitly created. 
# Their names are always reserved and should not be used for other variables.

# The most commonly used magic variables are hostvars, groups, group_names, and inventory_hostname. 
# With hostvars, you can access variables defined for any host in the play, at any point in a playbook. 
# You can access Ansible facts using the hostvars variable too, but only after you have gathered (or cached) facts

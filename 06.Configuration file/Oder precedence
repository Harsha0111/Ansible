Suppose if we've "n" no.of.inventory file for each project/directory

it's too difficult to change the defaults in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg , 
so there is a solution below!!!

******Solution*********
The configuration file:

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:

ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)

ansible.cfg (in the current directory)

~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found, all others are ignored.

Ansible:
        **********Scenario**********
        If you have 1 server/system  you can easily execute some set of commands "REPEATEDLY", suppose 
        10 or 100 or "n" no.of. servers? What will you do, it will be very tedious task and time waste process.

        **********Solution**********
        "-----That's why ANSIBLE CAME------------"
        Ansible is a  "POWERFUL AUTOMATION TOOL" can automate the above mentioned tedious tasks as "SIMPLE"

        **********Advantages**********          
        Agentless --> means we "NO NEED TO INSTALL ANY TOOLS/AGENT" on NODE/REMOTE machine to connect with ansible master 
        Open-source  --> free of cost

        You can connect to remote machine by Ansible master through "SSH" and after connecting to remote machine by Ansible master
        we can install apps anything as your normal machine.

Adhoc pattern:

       ******** plz refer pattern img atteched in yhis folder********** .
        Patterns are highly flexible - you can exclude or require subsets of hosts,
         use wildcards or regular expressions, and more. 
         
        Ansible executes on all inventory hosts included in the pattern.

example:
                                    <pattern>
ansible -m <module_name> webservers:dbservers:&staging:!phoenix -i <Inventory_filename>

targets all machines in the groups ‘webservers’ and ‘dbservers’ that are also in the group ‘staging’, 
except any machines in the group ‘phoenix’.

What is Ad-hoc command:
  * Ad hoc commands are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions, instead of writing playbook.

  * These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration management and deployment because 
   commands are "one-time usage". 

  *  It's a "COMMAND-LINE"tool for Ansible. 

  * The command module is used to run simple Linux commands on a remote node or server,
   which is a part of the host group or standalone server mentioned in the host group i.e., Inventory file/ default hosts file.

  * syntax: ansible -m <module_name> -i <Inventory_filename> <host group or standalone server>
        eg: $ ansible -m ping -i hosts grp1  
        used to check the remote machine server reachability


   For example, used to run any commands or run any scripts in the remote target machine.
    Or used to execute commands on a remote node.

    ad hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat rarely. 
    For example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Christmas vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook. An ad hoc command looks like this:

        $ ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"

        -a "[module options]" --> it's argument for module we can pass some linux cmnds, key=value
